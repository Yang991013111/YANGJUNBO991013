                            Three years ago, 14-year-old Xiao Tang was in
                            the first year of junior high school. His parents
                            divorced when he was in fifth grade, and Xiao
                            Tang had lived with his father, Tang Xueli, for the
                            past two years. One day, Tang Xueli came home
                            from get off work and opened the door to a "very
                            piercing sound." He went into the child's room,
                            where Xiao Tang was watching a livestream (or
                            perhaps a cartoon; during the interview, Tang
                            Xueli couldn't quite tell the difference). He felt
                            as if he "heard a burst of mournful music," and
                            he accused Xiao Tang, "You're hearing the same
                            thing as a dead person."

                            Tang Xueli admitted, "The child's current situation
                            is definitely closely related to the divorce and his
                            leaving his mother." One day, when he came home
                            from get off work, he found Xiao Tang crying in
                            his room. Xiao Tang told his father, "At school, my
                            classmates look down on me because I don't have a
                            mother." Tang Xueli told me that a significant number
                            of children at the Linyi Internet Addiction Treatment
                            Center are troubled by their parents' divorces and
                            remarriages.

                            demon." Xiao Tang began smashing things like
                            a table, then a bench, and finally the TV in the
                            living room. Unable to stop him, Tang Xueli
                            retreated to his room. He later tried to reconcile
                            with the child, but to no avail. That same night,
                            Tang Xueli was awakened by a loud noise. Xiao
                            Tang smashed down his door with a bench.

                            divorce, feeling it was "too complicated to explain."
                            He admitted he couldn't control his son. Tang Xueli
                            described Xiao Tang as playing computer games until
                            midnight every day. He urged his son to go to bed,
                            but "as soon as he heard that, he got angry and started
                            smashing things," eventually smashing the TV.

                            of Linyi, he had a relative who worked there and "had
                            known the center since its inception." Knowing Xiao
                            Tang wouldn't want to go, Tang Xueli lied to him,
                            saying he was going to buy a computer. With the help
                            of the center staff, his son "never left after entering."

                            Parents often place restrictions on their children's
                            hobbies, such as basketball and figurine collecting,
                            based on an overemphasis on academic performance,
                            traditional educational values, strict time management
                            requirements, preconceived notions of the future, or
                            an overprotective mentality. However, the underlying
                            reason behind these restrictions may be a parent's
                            desire to maintain authority within the family, using
                            harsh parenting methods to demonstrate control and
                            ensure absolute obedience. In short, parents seek a
                            psychological sense of dominance, and when direct
                            discipline seems too harsh, they seek to maintain their
                            image as "good parents" with a clear conscience.

                            Duct tape and rope were wrapped around her, binding her immobile. However, the person

                            She sat across from Li Mei, refusing her a single grain of rice or a single drop of water.
                            She also repeatedly
                            assaulted her with electric batons and other sharp objects.
